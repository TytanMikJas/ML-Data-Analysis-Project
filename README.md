# Netflix Data Analysis and Popularity Prediction Project ðŸŽ¥


Welcome to my data analysis and machine learning project on Netflix series and movies! This project marks the beginning of my journey into the exciting world of AI, deep learning, and machine learning. Although I had NO prior ML experience (therefore this project is very begginer-like), this endeavor motivated me to explore and learn more about AI.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to analyze the data provided by Netflix and build a machine learning model to predict the popularity of series and movies. The popularity prediction can help Netflix and content creators understand the factors that influence the audience's preferences and improve the overall streaming experience for users.

## Background
Originally, I planned to work on a stock analysis project. However, due to the complexity of stock data and my limited competence in that area, I decided to shift my focus to Netflix data analysis. This pivot allowed me to explore various data analysis and machine learning techniques while working with a more manageable dataset.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: The core programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning model development.
2. Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used extensively in this project.
3. NumPy: Essential for numerical operations on the data.
4. Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization, enabling insightful graphical representations.
5. Scikit-learn: Utilized for building and evaluating machine learning models.
6. Jupyter Notebook: An interactive coding environment that facilitated experimentation and documentation.

## Data Collection
When it came to the initial (stock) project I have menaged to scrape data from two different websites.
With Netflix, the first step was to collect Netflix's data, which included information about series and movies available on the platform. I used data provided from Kaggle.
